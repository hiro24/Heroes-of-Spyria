Welcome to \c[6]Spyria\c[0]! A land of beauty and 
strife. A great war is ravaging much of the 
world, as the nation of \c[6]Ishtar\c[0] battles 
the kingdom of \c[6]Argonia\c[0]. 

However, an ancient evil seeks to exact his 
revenge upon an unsuspecting world after 
a thousand years of imprisonment. 

You play the role of the hero, thrust into the 
middle of a struggle with nothing less than 
the fate of the world at stake.
